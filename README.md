# Key Master

An old project of mine, made as an off-line password manager for an unconnected raspberry pi mini. Started a while back, picked up again recently

Still *under construction* so take special notice ;). Now working on SQL databases for all the data!

> TO DO: 
> - .csv "database"
> - settings 1,2,3
> - sql database (mysql/plsql)
